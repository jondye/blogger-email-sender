# blogger-email-sender
A web app for sending blogger posts as emails

# Setup
You will need to create a client_secrets.json file containing your google api credentials as described in https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/aaa_client_secrets

You will need to create a config.py file containing the settings for the application, e.g.

    GMAIL_USERNAME = 'sender@example.com'
    GMAIL_PASSWORD = 'opensesame'
    SECRET_KEY = '01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-4567890abcde'
